Changelog - 4/20/2014

[UUID]
In Section 1, we clarified that UUIDs should be generated using the machine's random number generator (as opposed to other methods such as time-based UUIDs). This eliminates any realistic possibility that UUIDs will conflict.

We also specified that UUID fields do not need to be converted to network byte order and provided justification for it: (1) the byte order
of a UUID does not affect its randomness and (2) UUIDs do not need to be interpreted
using the same byte order across hosts - individual hosts only need to interpret them in a
consistent byte order.

[Rat Direction]
We opted to change the Direction enumeration in our protocol to be the same as the starter code's ( 0 is North, 1 is South, 2 is East, and 3 is West). This makes implementation easier.

[Missile state in KEEPALIVE]
Missile state is no longer optional in the KEEPALIVE packet even when the Missile Flag is not set. This avoids variable length KEEPALIVE packets and reduces implementation complexity.
